# Overthrow 2021 Priest-Dev 
## (Work in Progress 1wk-2wk expected merge to main branch)
* ALl changes are subject to more changes and complaints
* In development to revive priests into tech-priests (not the 40k kind)
* Tech-priests are currently called "Arch-Crypto" _fullname. 
* They will spawn near churches, work as a money sink to raise late/mid game resistance support in different cities.
* They will keep a bank for you, linked like the network of warehouses 
* Banking with them will make passive income to completely absolve the need for trading in the late game (out rank it in efficiency).
* Currency of "money" or cash in hand, will have a capacity of 1-5 million
* After 1-5 million, the rest will automatically get converted into the denominations of this new currency system.
* You cannot buy anything in-land with new currency, but its purpose is to faciliate the growth of income for late game assaults
* It will also hopefully prevent spamming the server with 1000++++ huntIR monitors for late game trade to make the best money.
* May even Cap off the infinite sizes of trucks working from import shops. (Maybe)
