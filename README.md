# Overthrow 2021 Features
* Perks are D20 based and can be reset
* Perks in stealth and trade are useful for their intended uses
* Drug prices for half ounces of weed and cocaine has standardized to 2010 prices by the DEA.
* Drug selling now is based on stability and population in the real world way it works.
* Drug selling is more profitable
* Drug selling destabilizes a lot more frequently
* Getting caught with drugs is based on stealth stats on character sheets
* Drug buying is based on trading stats now, higher stat, lower the price
* Backpack is reverted to original intended values
* "Bag" class of 'ACE_Fakebackpack' within 'Base_Bag' is now renamed "Bucci Bag" appropriately priced and set at 295 Max carry weight
* Houses can now be bought from other players going over a Deedlock mechanic
* Deedlock is set to 21 houses (buildings)
* Buying houses now tell the player how much houses you own, how many you leased and the cap.
* Players under 21 houses are protected from being evicted of their homes.
* Evicting other players above 21 cap cannot be done to their home spawns.
* Evicting other players will refund their MSRP price minus current market cut.
* Taxes earned are standardized on a X*(0.00001(x)) format for 10k-79k (lease income only)
* Taxes beyond 79k results in a flat cutting to any income above 29k to balance monopoly
* All extra taxed money go to resistant funds as usual, for generals to buy expensive armies
* Drugs are now more frequently sold at around 70-90% success in initiating trade
* Initiating trade should also base on skill, a little RNG based on stability/population of the town
* Standardized truck functions, all big trucks have infinite gear intake through Y menu
* All trucks boosted in maximumLoad, small trucks doubled, big trucks became mobile ammo boxes in loot carry capacity
* General make is toggle option now, make/revoke general.
